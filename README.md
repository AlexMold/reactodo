# reactodo

Multiple localStorage TODO lists, built with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react)

* http://insin.github.io/reactodo/

Designed and styled after quick, disposable TODO tracking of the type commonly
done in a programmer's text editor, but with a few interactive niceties to
manage items instead of cut + paste.
